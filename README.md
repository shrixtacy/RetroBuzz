## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash

## 🧪 AI Logic Examples

### Pattern Detection
```typescript
// If user opens: Notepad → Paint → Notepad
// AI predicts: Paint (85% confidence)
// Reason: "Detected repeated workflow pattern"
```

### Frequency-Based Prediction
```typescript
// Most used app gets priority in Start Menu
// Recent usage (< 5 min) gets confidence boost
// Confidence = (openCount / 10) * 0.5 + recencyBonus
```

### Adaptive Error Handling
```typescript
// Beginner users: More helpful dialogs
// Advanced users: Minimal interference
// Error frequency affects user level classification
```
